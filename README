Building and running SimScheduler

For Windows, to get it to run on you will need to have 
Visual Studio or Visual C++ Express to open up
the solution, build it, run it.

Open up SimScheduler.sln
Build
Run

For Linux, to get it to run on linux all you need to do is...

./configure
make
cd src
./SimScheduler in0.txt output.txt -FCFS -RR1 -RR2 -MLFQ
